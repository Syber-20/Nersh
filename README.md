## How to Add New Terms

To add a new term to the search engine, you can use the provided **shell script** (`AddTerm.sh`) or the **Java program** (`AddTerm.java`). Both tools automate the process of adding terms and creating the required HTML files.

### **Using the Shell Script (`AddTerm.sh`)**
The shell script provides an interactive way to add new terms and create HTML files with built-in styling. It also allows you to edit the HTML file using your preferred text editor.

#### Steps:
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   bash AddTerm.sh
   ```
2. Enter the term name when prompted.
3. Choose whether to edit the HTML file using nano, vim, or skip editing.
4. The script will:
   - Create a styled HTML file in the appropriate directory
   - Update the terms.json file with the new term
   - Optionally commit the changes to Git

Example:
```
$ bash AddTerm.sh
Enter the term: Machine Learning
New term added successfully to JSON!
Do you want to edit the HTML file? (nano/vim/none): nano
HTML file created at terms/m/Machine_Learning.html
Do you want to commit the new term added? (yes/no): yes
Changes committed.
Done!
```

### **Using the Java Program (`AddTerm.java`)**

The Java program updates the JSON file with new terms, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining alphabetical order.

#### Steps:
1. Compile the Java program:
   ```
   javac AddTerm.java
   ```

2. Run the program with the term name as an argument:
   ```
   java AddTerm <TERM_NAME>
   ```

3. The program will:
   - Update the `terms.json` file in the appropriate directory
   - Print a success message if the term is added

Example:
```
$ java AddTerm "Artificial Intelligence"
New term added successfully to JSON!
```

## Search Functionality

The search function provides real-time suggestions as you type:
1. Enter a term in the search box
2. Select from the dropdown of suggestions or press Enter
3. If the term exists, you'll be redirected to the term's page
4. Use the "I'm Feeling Nerdy" button to discover random tech terms
