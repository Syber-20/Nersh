# Nersh

Nersh is a simple web project hosted on GitHub Pages that allows users to search for technology-related terms and view their definitions. The project uses Markdown files to store each term's definition, and the terms are organized in a directory structure based on the first letter of each term. Users can navigate between terms using "next" and "previous" buttons on the definition pages.
